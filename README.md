Cosmic Quiz

A simple trivia application that asks questions about physics. It uses a mouse click interface to start the quiz and select answers before the timer counts down. Once the quiz is finished, it displays the number of correct answers, wrong answers and the number of times the user ran out of time without selecting an answer. The application is designed in a way that makes it very easy to update the quiz questions and answers as well as the length of the quiz and allowable time to answer questions. 

This application uses html and bootstrap for mobile responsiveness, css for stylization and javascript and jQuery for the functionality.
